# Expert System for Programming Language Selection
This expert system is designed to assist users in selecting a programming language that best suits their needs. It uses Prolog programming language to define the different programming languages and their characteristics, as well as a set of questions and corresponding answers to guide the user through the selection process.

## How to Use
1. Run the expert_system.pl file using a Prolog interpreter.
2. Answer the prompts that appear on the screen. The prompts will ask you about the type of language you need, whether you need a language for system programming, and whether you need a language for general purpose.
3. The expert system will use your answers to recommend a programming language that best fits your needs.

## Features
* The expert system considers the different characteristics of programming languages such as low-level or high-level, and system programming or general purpose.
* The expert system uses multiple choice questions for user input, with numerical answers corresponding to the options.
* The expert system uses a chaining question and answer approach, where each question is prompted based on the previous answer.
* The expert system uses Prolog programming language to define the different programming languages and their characteristics.

## Limitations
* The expert system is limited to the programming languages and characteristics that are defined in the code.
* The expert system only provides recommendations based on the user's answers to the questions, and does not take into account other factors that may be important in selecting a programming language, such as the specific project or task at hand.
* As the expert system uses Prolog, it may not be suitable for users who are not familiar with this programming language.

## Note
- Make sure you have a Prolog interpreter installed and configured on your computer before running the **expert_system.pl** file.
